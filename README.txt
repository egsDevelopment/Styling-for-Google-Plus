README file for Styling for Google Plus

** Going to make a major update soon. Sorry for the delays I have been extremely busy with work and school. Got some good ideas from users and am going to implement them  as soon as I can **

UPDATE: BETA RELEASE check it out here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ledokaaoodnghhbbeeofdplhihinhbcb

NOTE: If you have more questions or concerns you can also email eshaw@egs-development.com.

Some added features for your Google+ pages. Make your Google+ pages look how you want it to. Add my theme for a clean look for all of Google+.

Currently you can:
* Hide different parts of the top bar (ie: +Username, Gmail, Documents, Reader, etc)
* Hide different parts of the left column (ie: Sparks, Chat, Welcome, etc)
* Change the background color of the left column
* Hide different parts of the right column (ie: Suggestions, In your circles, hangout, etc)
* Change the background color of the right column
* Make the top, left column, and/or right column float
* Change the page background color
* Add unread Google Reader counter
* Add unread Gmail counter
* Change Text Colors
* Use my theme
* Use a wider version of my Theme
* Change the Nav Bar Background and Text
* One Fluent Nav Bar for all Major Links

I added a new Wide Theme (Screen Shots will come later) that is still in Beta due to some alignment issues (nothing to affect usability just aesthetics). Hope you enjoy I am planning on making a couple simple themes and maybe allow you to upload your own CSS. V1.9.2

Shrunk the file size down significantly.

Gmail and Google Reader will need to be logged in (but don't have to stay open) in order for the counters to update. Otherwise I would need your Gmail/Reader email and password to get them more fluently which I feel is a bit of a privacy breach.

Permissions:
* Your data on: 
** plus.google.com : this is for injecting the css that is required to create the themes and hide/float different elements of the Google+ pages.
** www.google.com : this is for the Google Reader unread counter - it just queries your Google Reader for its unread count.
** mail.google.com : this is for your Gmail unread counter - it just queries your Gmail for its unread count.
** picasaweb.google.com: this is so that the Nav bar is standard throughout most pages

* Your tabs and browsing activity : this is used when you do save and refresh on the options page. The extension scans through your tabs and finds the one containing plus.google.com and refreshes that page.

!!!!! I am in no way storing or taking any of your information you are more then welcome to check my code to verify that !!!!!!
